        <h3>What IS carbonara?</h3>
        <p>Carbonara is yumyum in the tumtum. Pasta, cheese sauce, and bacon? Gimme gimme! "Traditionally" made with pecorino romano and parmigiano reggiano for the cheesiness and guanciale for the baconess. I'll substitute with generic "bacon" and parmigiano-like hard cheeses.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Parmigiano-like cheese</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water in a large pot and chuck in the pasta forcefully (no splash, no flavour!).</li>
            <li>Grate more cheese than you think you need (even accounting for this advice).</li>
            <li>Mix the grated cheese with the contents of an egg in a bowl (don't use the eggshells).</li>
            <li>Fry up the bacon in a large pan or pot (as all the pasta will eventually end up in here).</li>
            <li>When pasta is cooked transfer it into the pan with the bacon (fire off) and bring some starchy pasta water over too.</li>
            <li>Stir the cheese/egg mix into the bacon/pasta pot/pan. Mix well!</li>
        </ol>
